abstract: The widespread presence of hate speech on the internet, including formats
  such as text-based tweets and multimodal memes, poses a significant challenge to
  digital platform safety. Recent research has developed detection models tailored
  to specific modalities; however, there is a notable gap in transferring detection
  capabilities across different formats. This study conducts extensive experiments
  using few-shot in-context learning with large language models to explore the transferability
  of hate speech detection between modalities. Our findings demonstrate that text-based
  hate speech examples can significantly enhance the classification accuracy of vision-language
  hate speech. Moreover, text-based demonstrations outperform vision-language demonstrations
  in few-shot learning settings. These results highlight the effectiveness of cross-modality
  knowledge transfer and offer valuable insights for improving hate speech detection
  systems.
