abstract: To address the limitations of current hate speech detection models, we introduce
  SGHateCheck, a novel framework designed for the linguistic and cultural context
  of Singapore and Southeast Asia. It extends the functional testing approach of HateCheck
  and MHC, employing large language models for translation and paraphrasing into Singapore`s
  main languages, and refining these with native annotators. SGHateCheck reveals critical
  flaws in state-of-the-art models, highlighting their inadequacy in sensitive content
  moderation. This work aims to foster the development of more effective hate speech
  detection tools for diverse linguistic environments, particularly for Singapore
  and Southeast Asia contexts.
