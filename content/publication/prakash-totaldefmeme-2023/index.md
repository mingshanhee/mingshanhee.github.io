abstract: Total Defence is a defence policy combining and extending the concept of
  military defence and civil defence. While several countries have adopted total defence
  as their defence policy, very few studies have investigated its effectiveness. With
  the rapid proliferation of social media and digitalisation, many social studies
  have been focused on investigating policy effectiveness through specially curated
  surveys and questionnaires either through digital media or traditional forms. However,
  such references may not truly reflect the underlying sentiments about the target
  policies or initiatives of interest. People are more likely to express their sentiment
  using communication mediums such as starting topic thread on forums or sharing memes
  on social media. Using Singapore as a case reference, this study aims to address
  this research gap by proposing TotalDefMeme, a large-scale multi-modal and multi-attribute
  meme dataset that captures public sentiments toward Singapore's Total Defence policy.
  Besides supporting social informatics and public policy analysis of the Total Defence
  policy, TotalDefMeme can also support many downstream multi-modal machine learning
  tasks, such as aspect-based stance classification and multi-modal meme clustering.
  We perform baseline machine learning experiments on TotalDefMeme and evaluate its
  technical validity, and present possible future interdisciplinary research directions
  and application scenarios using the dataset as a baseline.
