abstract: 'Recent studies have proposed models that yielded promising performance
  for the hateful meme classification task. Nevertheless, these proposed models do
  not generate interpretable explanations that uncover the underlying meaning and
  support the classification output. A major reason for the lack of explainable hateful
  meme methods is the absence of a hateful meme dataset that contains ground truth
  explanations for benchmarking or training. Intuitively, having such explanations
  can educate and assist content moderators in interpreting and removing flagged hateful
  memes. This paper address this research gap by introducing Hateful meme with Reasons
  Dataset (HatReD), which is a new multimodal hateful meme dataset annotated with
  the underlying hateful contextual reasons. We also define a new conditional generation
  task that aims to automatically generate underlying reasons to explain hateful memes
  and establish the baseline performance of state-of-the-art pre-trained language
  models on this task. We further demonstrate the usefulness of HatReD by analyzing
  the challenges of the new conditional generation task in explaining memes in seen
  and unseen domains. The dataset and benchmark models are made available here: https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/HatRed'
