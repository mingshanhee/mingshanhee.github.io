abstract: Moderating hate speech (HS) in the evolving online landscape is a complex
  challenge, compounded by the multimodal nature of digital content. This survey examines
  recent advancements in HS moderation, focusing on the burgeoning role of large language
  models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) in detecting, explaining, debiasing,
  and countering HS. We begin with a comprehensive analysis of current literature,
  uncovering how text, images, and audio interact to spread HS. The combination of
  these modalities adds complexity and subtlety to HS dissemination. We also identified
  research gaps, particularly in underrepresented languages and cultures, and highlight
  the need for solutions in low-resource settings. The survey concludes with future
  research directions, including novel AI methodologies, ethical AI governance, and
  the development of context-aware systems. This overview aims to inspire further
  research and foster collaboration towards responsible and human-centric approaches
  to HS moderation in the digital age.
