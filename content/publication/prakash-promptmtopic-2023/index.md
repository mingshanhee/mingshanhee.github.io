abstract: "The proliferation of social media has given rise to a new form of communication:
  memes. Memes are multimodal and often contain a combination of text and visual elements
  that convey meaning, humor, and cultural significance. While meme analysis has been
  an active area of research, little work has been done on unsupervised multimodal
  topic modeling of memes, which is important for content moderation, social media
  analysis, and cultural studies. We propose PromptMTopic, a novel multimodal prompt-based
  model designed to learn topics from both text and visual modalities by leveraging
  the language modeling capabilities of large language models. Our model effectively
  extracts and clusters topics learned from memes, considering the semantic interaction
  between the text and visual modalities. We evaluate our proposed model through extensive
  experiments on three real-world meme datasets, which demonstrate its superiority
  over state-of-the-art topic modeling baselines in learning descriptive topics in
  memes. Additionally, our qualitative analysis shows that PromptMTopic can identify
  meaningful and culturally relevant topics from memes. Our work contributes to the
  understanding of the topics and themes of memes, a crucial form of communication
  in today's society. Disclaimer: This paper contains sensitive content that may be
