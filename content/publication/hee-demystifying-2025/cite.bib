 abstract = {Hateful meme detection presents a significant challenge as a multimodal task due to the complexity of interpreting implicit hate messages and contextual cues within memes. Previous approaches have fine-tuned pre-trained vision-language models (PT-VLMs), leveraging the knowledge they gained during pre-training and their attention mechanisms to understand meme content. However, the reliance of these models on implicit knowledge and complex attention mechanisms renders their decisions difficult to explain, which is crucial for building trust in meme classification. In this paper, we introduce IntMeme, a novel framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for hateful meme classification with explainable decisions. IntMeme addresses the dual challenges of improving both accuracy and explainability in meme moderation. The framework uses LMMs to generate human-like, interpretive analyses of memes, providing deeper insights into multimodal content and context. Additionally, it uses independent encoding modules for both memes and their interpretations, which are then combined to enhance classification performance. Our approach addresses the opacity and misclassification issues associated with PT-VLMs, optimizing the use of LMMs for hateful meme detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IntMeme through comprehensive experiments across three datasets, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art models.},
