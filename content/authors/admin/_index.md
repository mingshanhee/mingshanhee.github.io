#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/), under the research supervision of Prof. [Roy Ka-Wei Lee](https://info.roylee.sg/). I am honored to have received several prestigious scholarships and awards, including the SUTD President's Graduate Fellowship and the Singapore Data Science Consortium (SDSC) Dissertation Research Fellowship 2024, which support and fund my Ph.D. studies. Additionally, I have had the privilege of serving as a reviewer for several top-tier conferences and co-organizing SSNLP 2024 and 2025.

My Ph.D. research focuses on developing trustworthy and explainable approaches for hateful content moderation, particularly in multimodal settings. By leveraging large multimodal models (LMMs) and post-hoc explanation techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), my work improves both detection accuracy and interpretability while mitigating biases in model predictions. Ultimately, my research contributes to online trust and safety by improving the explainability of AI-driven moderation systems, ensuring fairer and more accountable decision-making. The findings have significant implications, particularly in content moderation, where balancing performance, fairness, and explainability is essential for real-world deployment.
